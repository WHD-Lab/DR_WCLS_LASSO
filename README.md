# DR_WCLS_LASSO

The core function of this package **DR_WCLS_LASSO** allows users to perform variable selection, estimate time-varying causal effects and make valid inferences conditional on the selected variables.

# Introduction

Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions delivered via smartphones. In practice, the assumptions required for MRTs are often difficult to satisfy: randomization probabilities can be uncertain, observations are frequently incomplete, and prespecifying features from high-dimensional contexts for linear working models is also challenging. To address these issues, the **doubly robust weighted centered least squares (DR-WCLS)** framework provides a flexible procedure for variable selection and inference. The methods incorporates supervised learning algorithms and enables valid inference on time-varying causal effects in longitudinal settings.
